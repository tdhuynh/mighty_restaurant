# mighty_restaurant

This was a partner assignment to emulate an environment where we work with others on the same project.

# Objective
* Break a large project into manageable units
* Work with an overwhelmingly broad and "vague" requirements list
* Deliver custom features that you believe will add value to the application.


# Features:
* A user should be able to create an account and set their access level as a cook, a server, or an owner
* An owner should be able to create menu items and set prices for food items
* A server should be able to make an order for a table from a list of available menu options
* A server should be able to add any notes to the order
* A server should be able to submit the order to the cooks in the back
* A cook should be able to see a list of incoming food requests
* A cook should be able to mark an order as completed
* A server should be able to mark a table as paid
